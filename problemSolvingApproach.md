// Problem solving approach

01. Understanding the problem

    - Restate the problem is own words.
    - What are the input and outputs?
    - Is there enough information to solve the problem?
    - Thinking of labelling data (don't use random label like i, j, k).
    - checking the example with invalid, empty input.

02. Note own details like input, output.

03. Start with the naive/brute force approach. First thing that comes into mind. It shows that you are able to think well and critically (You don't need to write this code, just speak about it).
 
04. Tell them why this approach is not the best (i.e. O(n^2) or higher, not readable, etc...)

05. Walk through your approach, comment things and see where you may be able to break things

06. Before you start coding, walk through your code and write down the steps you are going to follow

07. Breakdown the steps and commenting is the ultimate key, Rundown of thinking process, steps. Breaking down the code will give you the     extra advantages

08. Start coding (simplify as necessary)

09. Can you write better in terms of readability, time, space complexity?
